# Accessibility And Search Engine Optimization

The purpose of this project was to refactor already existing code for a website in order to make it more accessible to users.

## What was done:
* Added alt attributes to the image files and gave the website a title. This will allow people with disabilities to more easily be able to utilize this website, as well as optimize search engine results.
* Added semantic elements in place of non-semantic elements to make code easier to read.
* Added comments to help navigate separate sections of code.
* Rearranged CSS selectors to be in sequential order.
* Deleted unnecessary ID attributes in content section to make code easier to read.
